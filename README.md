# Robotics Simulation

*The simulator program is credited to Roderic Grupen, professor of Computer science and director of the Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.*
*The simulator program was removed on purpose on github. Only project files are displayed.*

## Relevant Skills:

- ### Stereo Localization
The robot uses its stereo vision(two eyes) to appoximate the depth of the vision to localize the red ball.

- ### PD Control  
The robot can move smoothly like a car with suspension.  
*Spring-Mass-Damper, Critical Damping, Open/Closed-Loop Control, Laplace Transform, etc.*

- ### Kinematics
The robot moves its arm to hit the red ball.
*Forward and Inverse kinematics.*

- ### Finite State Machine
After the red ball is out of sight after the successfull attack,  
the robot transforms into the "Defense" mode based on the status of the finite state machine.
